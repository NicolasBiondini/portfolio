        My name is Nicolás Biondini, I’m 23 and I’m from Argentina. I’m a{" "}
        <b>Front-End developer</b> but before that, I studied 3 years of{" "}
        Economics at Universidad Nacional del Sur.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been passionate about technology, and in my first year of
        college, I started getting interested in tech business (Silicon Valley,
        Startups, and that kind of stuff). So <b>parallel to the university</b>,
        I started to study, on my own, finance, business models, marketing,
        e-commerce, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and everything that surrounds
        a <b>startup or tech company</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <b>love and passion for tech</b> companies grew and grew so much
        that I wanted to be part of it. I knew a little about business, I knew
        about marketing but still needed the third leg of the table:{" "}
        <b>to learn how to code</b>. It was frustrating to understand things and
        try to contribute to the real world but be limited because you don't
        understand how tech works.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing my third year of university, I decided (after much
        thought) to drop Economics and start learning how to code. All that
        happened just at the beginning of 2020 so, as you know, pandemic times.
        I stayed home and started learning to code{" "}
        <b>10 hours per day from Monday to Friday</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with a Python book, but after I finished it I felt lost. But
        then I found a <b>web dev roadmap</b> and started with Harvard’s CS50
        course, an HTML and CSS book, Free Code Camp certifications, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here I am today. After all this path I’m confident in myself, with
        all the <b>energy, hunger, and ambition</b> to make things and to
        continue <b>learning and improving</b> every day.
